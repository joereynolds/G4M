## Notes

- Tests can be ran with `composer test`

- There is a simple demonstration of its usage in `index.php`

- I'm omitted `@param` annotation where there is enough information in the function's
  signature as it's duplicated and redundant

- Given more time I'd inject the `Courier`s into the `Batch` to aid in better
  testability and extensibility

- Locally I have php 7.2 but ideally I'd be on 7.4 which would allow me to type
  the properties in a class
